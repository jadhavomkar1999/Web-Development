            <p>Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro GOIH ComM (Portuguese pronunciation: [kɾiʃˈtjɐnu ʁɔˈnaldu]; born 5 February 1985)
                is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Saudi Professional League club
                Al Nassr and the Portugal national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won
                five Ballon d'Or awards[note 3] and four European Golden Shoes, the most by a European player. He has won 32
                trophies in his career, including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, the UEFA European Championship
                and the UEFA Nations League. Ronaldo holds the records for most appearances (183), goals (140) and assists (42) in
                the Champions League, goals in the European Championship (14), international goals (123) and international
                appearances (200). He is one of the few players to have made over 1,100 professional career appearances, and has
                scored over 800 official senior career goals for club and country. He is the only player to score in five different
                FIFA World Cup tournaments.
            
                Ronaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003, winning the FA Cup
                in his first season. He would also go on to win three consecutive Premier League titles, the Champions League and
                the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most expensive
                association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth €94 million (£80 million).
                He became a key contributor and formed an attacking trio with Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale which was integral to
                the team winning four Champions League wins from 2014 to 2018, including La Décima. During this period, he won
                back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016 and 2017, and was runner-up three times behind Lionel
                Messi, his perceived career rival. He also became the club's all-time top goalscorer and the all-time top scorer in
                the Champions League, and finished as the competition's top scorer for six consecutive seasons between 2012 and
                2018. With Real, Ronaldo won four Champions Leagues, two La Liga titles, two Copas del Rey, three UEFA Super Cups
                and three Club World Cups. In 2018, he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth an initial €100 million (£88
                million), the most expensive transfer for an Italian club and for a player over 30 years old. He won two Serie A
                titles, two Supercoppa Italiana trophies and a Coppa Italia, became the inaugural Serie A Most Valuable Player and
                became the first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues. He returned to
                Manchester United in 2021, finishing his only full season as the club's top scorer, before his contract was
                terminated in 2022. In 2023, he signed for Al Nassr.
            
                Ronaldo made his international debut for Portugal in 2003 at the age of 18 and has since earned 200 caps, making him
                Portugal's most-capped player. With more than 100 goals at international level, he is also the all-time top
                goalscorer. Ronaldo has played in and scored at eleven major tournaments; he scored his first international goal at
                Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal reach the final. He assumed captaincy of the national team in July 2008. In
                2015, Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation. The following
                year, he led Portugal to their first major tournament title at Euro 2016, and received the Silver Boot as the
                second-highest goalscorer of the tournament. This achievement would see him receive his fourth Ballon d'Or. He also
                led them to victory in the inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019, receiving the top scorer award in the finals, and
                later received the Golden Boot as top scorer of Euro 2020.
            
                One of the world's most marketable and famous athletes, Ronaldo was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by
                Forbes in 2016 and 2017 and the world's most famous athlete by ESPN from 2016 to 2019. Time included him on their
                list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2014. He is the first footballer and the third sportsman to
                earn US$1 billion in his career.</p>

                <h2 id="new1">Early life</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born on 5 February 1985 in the São Pedro parish of Funchal, the capital of
                    the Portuguese island of Madeira, and grew up in the nearby parish of Santo António.[8][9] He is the fourth and
                    youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros da Aveiro, a cook, and José Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener
                    and part-time kit man.[10] His great-grandmother on his father's side, Isabel da Piedade, was from the island of São
                    Vicente, Cape Verde.[11] He has one older brother, Hugo, and two older sisters, Elma and Liliana Cátia "Katia".[12]
                    He was named after actor and U.S. President Ronald Reagan, whom his father was a fan of.[13] His mother revealed
                    that she wanted to abort him due to poverty, his father's alcoholism, and having too many children already, but her
                    doctor refused to perform the procedure,[14][15] as abortions were illegal in Portugal at that time.[16] Ronaldo
                    grew up in an impoverished Catholic Christian home, sharing a room with all his siblings.[17]
                
                    As a child, Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995,[18] where his father was the kit man,[10] and later
                    spent two years with Nacional. In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who signed him for a
                    fee of £1,500.[19] He subsequently moved from Madeira to Alcochete, near Lisbon, to join Sporting's youth
                    academy.[19] By age 14, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally and agreed with his mother
                    to cease his education to focus entirely on football.[20] With a troubled life as a student[21] and living in Lisbon
                    area away from his Madeiran family, he didn't complete schooling beyond the 6th grade.[22][23] While popular with
                    other students at school, he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, who he said had "disrespected"
                    him.[20] One year later, he was diagnosed with tachycardia, a condition that could have forced him to give up
                    playing football.[24] Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise multiple cardiac pathways
                    into one, altering his resting heart rate.[25] He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and
                    resumed training a few days later.[26]</p>

                <h2 id="new2">Club career</h2>
                <br>
                <h3>Sporting CP</h3>
                <br>
                <p>At age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team manager László Bölöni, who was impressed
                    with his dribbling.[27] He subsequently became the first player to play for the club's under-16, under-17 and
                    under-18 teams, the B team and the first team, all within a single season.[19] A year later, on 29 September 2002,
                    Ronaldo made his debut in the Primeira Liga, against Braga and on 7 October, he scored two goals against Moreirense
                    in their 3–0 win.[28] Over the course of the 2002–03 season, his representatives suggested the player to Liverpool
                    manager Gérard Houllier and Barcelona president Joan Laporta.[29] Manager Arsène Wenger, who was interested in
                    signing Ronaldo, met with him at Arsenal's stadium in November to discuss a possible transfer.[30]
                
                    Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was determined to acquire Ronaldo on a permanent move urgently, after
                    Sporting defeated United 3–1 at the inauguration of the Estádio José Alvalade in August 2003. Initially, United had
                    planned to sign Ronaldo and loan him back to Sporting for a year.[31] Having been impressed by him, the United
                    players urged Ferguson to sign him. After the game, Ferguson agreed to pay Sporting £12.24 million[31] for what he
                    considered to be "one of the most exciting young players" he had ever seen.[32] A decade after his departure from
                    the club, in April 2013, Sporting honoured Ronaldo by selecting him to become their 100,000th member.[33]</p>

                <br>
                <h4>2003–2007: Development and breakthrough</h4>
                <br>
                <p>Ronaldo's move to Manchester United was completed on 12 August 2003, too late for the 2003 FA Community Shield but in
                    time for their game against Bolton Wanderers on the opening day of the 2003–04 season, and made him the first
                    Portuguese player to sign for the club.[35] His transfer fee made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in
                    English football history.[36] Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the squad
                    number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and David
                    Beckham.[37] Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo.[38] A key element in his
                    development during his time in England proved to be Ferguson, of whom he later said: "He's been my father in sport,
                    one of the most important and influential factors in my career."[39]</p>
